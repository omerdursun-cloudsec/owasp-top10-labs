# OWASP Top 10 Labs (Hands-on Practice)

This repository contains my **hands-on security labs** for learning and practicing selected **OWASP Top 10 (2021)** vulnerabilities.

I am building this repo slowly, lab by lab — no rushing, no fake “completed in one week” portfolio.

---

## 📌 Structure (Planned)

Each vulnerability will have its own folder:


Each folder will include:

- `README.md` → Explanation of the vulnerability  
- Step-by-step exploitation notes  
- Mitigation ideas  
- Screenshots / PoC evidence (`/poc/` folder)  
- Simple vulnerable example if needed  

---

## 📚 Current Progress

I am currently building the first labs:

- [ ] 01 - Injection  
- [ ] 02 - Broken Access Control  
- [ ] 03 - Cryptographic Failures  
- [ ] 05 - Security Misconfiguration  

More will be added gradually as I learn.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is designed to:

- Strengthen my fundamentals in **Application Security**
- Learn by breaking → then fixing
- Create **proof-driven documentation**
- Track real progress instead of pretending skill

## 🧠 Status

> Work in progress.  
> I update this repository every time I complete a new lab or concept.
